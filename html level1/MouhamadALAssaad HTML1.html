            <h1><i>What is html5?</i> </h1>
            <p><b>HTML5</b> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. <br>
                It is the fifth and final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.<br>
                 The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. <br>
                 It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), <br>
                 a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft)</p>

            <h2><i>Features and APIs:</i></h2>
            <p>The W3C proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress,<br>
             meaning identifying specific features, either proposed or already existing in the spec, and advancing them as separate specifications. <br>
             Some technologies that were originally defined in HTML5 itself are now defined in separate specifications:<br>
                <ul>
                <li>HTML Working Group – HTML Canvas 2D Context;</li>
                <li>Web Apps Working Group – Web Messaging, Web workers, Web storage, WebSocket, <br>
                    Server-sent events, Web Components[91] (this was not part of HTML5, though);<br>
                    the Web Applications Working Group was closed in October 2015 and its deliverables transferred to the Web Platform Working Group (WPWG).</li>
                <li>IETF HyBi Working Group – WebSocket Protocol;</li>
                <li>WebRTC Working Group – WebRTC;</li>
                <li>Web Media Text Tracks Community Group – WebVTT.</li>
                </ul>

               <mark>Some features that were removed from the original HTML5 specification have been standardized separately as modules,<br>
                 such as Microdata and Canvas. Technical specifications introduced as HTML5 extensions such as Polyglot markup have also been standardized as modules. <br>
                 Some W3C specifications that were originally separate specifications have been adapted as HTML5 extensions or features, such as SVG.<br> 
                 <q>Some features that might have slowed down the standardization of HTML5 were or will be standardized as upcoming specifications, instead.</q></mark></p>
